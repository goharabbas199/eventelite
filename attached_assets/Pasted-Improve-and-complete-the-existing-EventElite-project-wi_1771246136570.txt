Improve and complete the existing EventElite project without changing the UI design.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT redesign layout.
Do NOT change colors.
Only improve functionality and fix missing logic.

========================
1) ADD LOGIN SYSTEM
========================

Create:
- login.html

Login Requirements:
- Email + Password fields
- Simple hardcoded admin login:
    Email: admin@eventelite.com
    Password: admin123
- Store login state in LocalStorage
- Redirect to dashboard after login
- Prevent access to dashboard pages if not logged in
- If not logged in → redirect to login.html
- Add Logout button in sidebar or navbar
- Logout clears login state and redirects to login page

========================
2) MAKE DASHBOARD CARDS CLICKABLE
========================

Stat cards on dashboard must redirect properly:

- Total Vendors → vendors.html
- Available Venues → venues.html
- Active Clients → clients.html
- Upcoming Events → budget.html

Add click event listeners.
Add hover cursor pointer.

========================
3) FIX NAVIGATION
========================

- Ensure all sidebar links work properly.
- Highlight active sidebar item based on current page.
- Prevent broken routes.
- Ensure breadcrumb navigation works.

========================
4) IMPLEMENT FULL CRUD FUNCTIONALITY
========================

For ALL modules:

VENDORS:
- Add vendor
- Delete vendor
- Edit vendor
- View vendor details
- Each vendor can have multiple products
- Delete product
- Edit product

VENUES:
- Add venue
- Delete venue
- Edit venue
- View venue details
- Each venue can have multiple booking options
- Delete booking option
- Edit booking option

CLIENTS:
- Add client
- Delete client
- Edit client
- View client details
- Delete planned services

BUDGET:
- Add expense
- Delete expense
- Edit expense
- Auto calculate totals
- Auto update balance
- Auto update status (On Track / Over Budget)

Each delete action must:
- Show confirmation popup
- Update LocalStorage
- Re-render UI immediately

========================
5) REMOVE STATIC HARDCODED TABLE ROWS
========================

- All tables must render dynamically from LocalStorage arrays.
- No hardcoded HTML rows.
- Create reusable render functions:

    renderVendors()
    renderVenues()
    renderClients()
    renderBudget()
    renderProducts()
    renderBookingOptions()

========================
6) FIX SEARCH FUNCTION (FULLY WORKING)
========================

Search bar must work dynamically.

Requirements:

- Real-time filtering while typing
- Case insensitive
- Works per page:

    Vendors → search name & category
    Venues → search name & location
    Clients → search name & event type
    Budget → search expense item

- No page reload
- If no results → show “No results found”
- Add clear (X) button inside search field

Implementation:
- Detect current page
- Filter existing data arrays
- Re-render filtered results

========================
7) IMPROVE DATA STRUCTURE
========================

Use structured LocalStorage format:

vendors = [
  {
    id,
    name,
    category,
    contact,
    notes,
    products: []
  }
]

venues = [
  {
    id,
    name,
    location,
    capacity,
    basePrice,
    extraCharges,
    bookingOptions: []
  }
]

clients = [
  {
    id,
    name,
    eventDate,
    eventType,
    budget,
    status,
    services: []
  }
]

expenses = [
  {
    id,
    clientId,
    vendorId,
    productName,
    cost,
    paid
  }
]

========================
8) CLEAN CODE STRUCTURE
========================

- Refactor script.js into modular sections
- Avoid duplicated logic
- Use reusable helper functions
- Add comments
- Keep everything expandable
- Use event delegation where needed

========================
9) ENSURE RESPONSIVENESS
========================

- Sidebar responsive
- Tables scroll properly
- Search works on all screen sizes

========================
GOAL
========================

Convert the current UI prototype into a fully working functional MVP SaaS dashboard with proper data handling and clean structure.

Do not redesign.
Only enhance functionality and fix all broken behaviors.
